      <p>Hello World!</p>
      <p>I'm on a Applied Technology Degree. I guess I will be a full stack developer but I'm not preatty sure about it. I love to play videogames and trainning on the gym everday. I'm single but will marry my bride soon. I am a trainee on a Marine Services Company. The thing a love at monst on BYU is how they care about the students. You can feel you're been followed during your study life. I've been a member of the church for my whole life.
      </p>

        I'm taking this course because I see how important for a programmer knowig how to built a graphic interface for a software running on a web plataform.
